# Course 1

# Two steps of image classifier
1. model training
2. image prediction

# L1-distance 
+ to represent the "distance", the magnitute of difference of two images.

**Question:** 
1. What does the term "axis" mean?
2. What is distance metric?
3. How to train the model through the training data, in an time complexity of O(1)?

# K-nearest neighbours(KNN)
+ to optimize the robustness of the algorithm, try to find a specific number of the nearest neighbour, and judge the color by majority. 

# L2 Distance (Euclidean)
+ square root of sum of square of differences. 

# Choose the best Hyperparameters for the algorithm
1. Split the data into 3 categories, train, validation and test
2. Use train to train the data
3. Use validation to choose the best hyperparameters
4. Use test to test the currency of data in wild case
+ Sometimes, the training data and validation data can be cross used for comparing and getting more accurate model.

# CIFAR10 - classic dataset for image training


# Linear Classification
1. Use functions, including Matrix, to calculate the scores for each category
2. Compare the scores and get the category which got the most score.
